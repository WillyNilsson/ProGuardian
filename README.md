Guardian 2.0 supervision for AI coding assistants. Aims to improve code quality, security, and best practices by transforming your AI assistant into a senior engineer who writes code with rigorous self-review.

## Why Does ProGuardian Exist?

Modern AI coding assistants are incredibly powerful, but they have a fundamental limitation: their primary goal is **task completion**. This can lead them to take shortcuts, introduce subtle bugs, "cheat" on tests to make them pass, or write code that is functional but not maintainable or secure.

ProGuardian attempts to address this by fundamentally reframing the AI's role. Instead of a developer focused on just getting the code written, the AI is encouraged to act as a **Senior Engineer (Guardian)** whose primary goal is **code quality through direct implementation with rigorous self-review**.

### Guardian 2.0: A Better Approach

The original Guardian protocol relied on delegation to subagents, which introduced accuracy problems due to context loss. Guardian 2.0 takes a different approach:

- **Direct Implementation**: Senior engineers write critical code themselves
- **Mechanical Self-Review**: Enforced review steps that require actual re-reading of code
- **Safety Rails**: Protection against deletions, scope creep, and other disasters
- **Penalties**: Real consequences for violations to reinforce proper behavior

This psychological shift is the key. By making the AI responsible for both implementation AND review, with mechanical steps that are designed to be followed, we aim for higher quality outcomes.

## How It Works

ProGuardian **enhances** your existing `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md` by adding the Guardian 2.0 protocol that:

1.  Preserves your AI CLI's project understanding
2.  Adds the Senior Engineer identity with direct implementation responsibility
3.  Implements mechanical review steps designed to encourage thorough review
4.  Adds safety rails to help reduce common issues
5.  Maintains all your project-specific context

Your enhanced file will look like:

## Key Features

### Guardian 2.0 Safety Rails

- 🛡️ **Deletion Protection**: Helps prevent unauthorized file/code deletion
- 🛡️ **Scope Validation**: Encourages changes to match what was requested
- 🛡️ **Existing Code Check**: Helps avoid duplicate implementations
- 🛡️ **Mechanical Review**: Encourages actual re-reading of changes

### Helps Reduce Common AI Issues

- ❌ Test cheating (modifying tests to pass)
- ❌ Placeholder code or TODOs
- ❌ Shortcuts or quick fixes
- ❌ Exposed secrets or security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Scope creep or unwanted "improvements"
- ❌ Skipping review steps

### Encourages Best Practices

- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Security-first approach
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Proper testing strategies
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
- ✅ Production-ready implementations
- ✅ Automatic issue fixes during review

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @proguardian/cli
```

## Quick Start

1.  **First, let your AI CLI analyze your project:**

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    claude init   # Creates CLAUDE.md with project understanding
    # OR
    gemini init   # Creates GEMINI.md with project understanding
    ```

2.  **Then add Guardian supervision:**

    ```bash
    proguardian init   # Auto-detects and enhances the appropriate file
    ```

3.  **Start coding with Guardian protection:**
    ```bash
    claude  # or gemini
    ```
