Guardian supervision for AI coding assistants. Ensures code quality, security, and best practices by transforming your AI assistant into a senior developer who delegates to and reviews its developers.

## Why Does ProGuardian Exist?

Modern AI coding assistants are incredibly powerful, but they have a fundamental limitation: their primary goal is **task completion**. This can lead them to take shortcuts, introduce subtle bugs, "cheat" on tests to make them pass, or write code that is functional but not maintainable or secure.

ProGuardian addresses this by fundamentally reframing the AI's role. Instead of a developer focused on just getting the code written, the AI becomes a **Senior Developer (Guardian)** whose primary goal is **code quality and review**.

This psychological shift is the key. By giving the AI seniority and making its core task the enforcement of best practices, we change its objective from "completing the task" to "ensuring the task is done correctly." This allows developers to adopt a more hands-off, supervisory role, trusting that the Guardian is enforcing quality standards.

This very project was built using the ProGuardian methodology with both Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, hopefully serving as a testament to its effectiveness.

## How It Works

ProGuardian **enhances** your existing `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md` by adding a Guardian section that:

1.  Preserves your AI CLI's project understanding
2.  Adds the Senior Developer identity and its corresponding psychological framework
3.  Implements quality gates and mandatory review cycles
4.  Maintains all your project-specific context

Your enhanced file will look like:

```markdown
# Original project context from claude init

[Project structure, dependencies, conventions...]

## üõ°Ô∏è GUARDIAN MODE ACTIVE

# GUARDIAN - Senior Developer Protocol

[Guardian instructions, checklists, workflows...]
```

## Key Features

### Prevents Common AI Issues

- ‚ùå No more test cheating (modifying tests to pass)
- ‚ùå No placeholder code or TODOs
- ‚ùå No shortcuts or quick fixes
- ‚ùå No exposed secrets or security vulnerabilities

### Enforces Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Security-first approach
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization
- ‚úÖ Proper testing strategies
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable code
- ‚úÖ Production-ready implementations

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @proguardian/cli
```

## Quick Start

1.  **First, let your AI CLI analyze your project:**

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    claude init   # Creates CLAUDE.md with project understanding
    # OR
    gemini init   # Creates GEMINI.md with project understanding
    ```

2.  **Then add Guardian supervision:**

    ```bash
    proguardian init   # Auto-detects and enhances the appropriate file
    ```

3.  **Start coding with Guardian protection:**
    ```bash
    claude  # or gemini
    ```
